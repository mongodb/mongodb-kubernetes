Assumptions and attestations:

1. Internal processes are used to ensure CVEs are identified and mitigated within SLAs.

2. The Dependency document does not specify third party OSS CVEs fixed by the release and the date we discovered them.

3. There is no CycloneDX field for original/modified CVSS score or discovery date. The `x-` prefix indicates this.
